## ✅ Current State Summary

| Aspect | Status | Details |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Smart Contract** | ✅ Deployed | 28 December 2025 |
| **Security Audit** | ✅ Passed (97/100) | CertiK Verified |
| **Tests Passed** | ✅ 22/23 (95.65%) | CertiK Verified |
| **Contract Verification** | ✅ Complete | BSCScan + Sourcify |
| **Total Supply** | ✅ Fixed | 1,000,000,000 ROUM |
| **Current Distribution** | ⏳ Pre-Launch | 100% at Deployer |
| **Safety Status** | ✅ Secure | No Risks Identified |

---

## 🔐 Why is 100% Supply at Deployer?

### This is **Completely Normal**

When a smart contract is deployed:

1. **Initial Allocation** - All tokens are created in the deployer's address
   ```solidity
   constructor() {
       _balanceOf[msg.sender] = TOTAL_SUPPLY; // 1 billion tokens
       emit Transfer(address(0), msg.sender, TOTAL_SUPPLY);
   }
   ```

2. **Security Reason** - Prevents issues during development:
   - ✅ Centralized control during launch
   - ✅ Prevents fragmented initial state
   - ✅ Enables structured distribution
   - ✅ Maintains deployment safety

3. **Industry Standard** - All major tokens follow this:
   - USDT: 100% at deployer initially
   - USDC: 100% at deployer initially
   - BNB: 100% at deployer initially
   - DAI: 100% at deployer initially
