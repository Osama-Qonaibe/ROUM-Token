## Phase 1: Initial Contract (To Be Burned)

### ⚠️ Status: RETIRED - To Be Burned

**What Happened:**
During initial development, the first contract was **accidentally deployed to Binance Smart Chain Mainnet** instead of Testnet. Upon discovery, we chose full transparency and decided to burn these tokens while developing a superior production version.
