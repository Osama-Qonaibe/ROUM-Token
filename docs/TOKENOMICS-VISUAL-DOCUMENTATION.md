## 📊 CHART 3: Investor Ownership Growth
### The Magic of Token Burns: Growing Your Share Without Buying More

![Ownership Growth](https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/6ac49f761bc8d4bf79a72e29fe925e7f/63151361-9bb7-4423-a9c8-789fc8649e74/fd14ffa4.png)

### Ownership Growth Example:

**Scenario:** An investor holds 1,000,000 ROUM tokens (0.1% of supply)

```
YEAR 0 (Initial):
├─ Supply: 1,000,000,000 ROUM
├─ Your Tokens: 1,000,000 ROUM
├─ Your Ownership: 0.1%
└─ Status: Baseline

YEAR 1 (After 50M Burn):
├─ Supply: 950,000,000 ROUM (-5%)
├─ Your Tokens: 1,000,000 ROUM (unchanged)
├─ Your Ownership: 0.105% (+5.26% relative increase)
└─ Benefit: You own more without buying! ✅

YEAR 2 (After 100M Burn):
├─ Supply: 900,000,000 ROUM (-10%)
├─ Your Tokens: 1,000,000 ROUM (unchanged)
├─ Your Ownership: 0.111% (+11.11% relative increase)
└─ Benefit: Ownership keeps growing! ✅

YEAR 3 (After 150M Burn):
├─ Supply: 850,000,000 ROUM (-15%)
├─ Your Tokens: 1,000,000 ROUM (unchanged)
├─ Your Ownership: 0.118% (+17.65% relative increase)
└─ Benefit: Further wealth accumulation! ✅

YEAR 4+ (After 200M Burn):
├─ Supply: 800,000,000 ROUM (-20%)
├─ Your Tokens: 1,000,000 ROUM (unchanged)
├─ Your Ownership: 0.125% (+25% relative increase)
└─ Benefit: Complete scarcity advantage! 🚀
```

### Why This Matters:

✅ **Wealth Preservation:** Protects against inflation  
✅ **Automatic Growth:** Ownership increases without effort  
✅ **Scarcity Benefit:** Token becomes rarer over time  
✅ **Value Support:** Reduced supply typically supports price  
✅ **Long-term Advantage:** Compound growth over years

## 📈 CHART 6: Price Projection Model
### Supply Reduction Impact on Value

![Price Projection](https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/6ac49f761bc8d4bf79a72e29fe925e7f/d7284011-e239-4c1d-ba38-14fbc8029c44/4463b90c.png)

### Economic Theory Behind Price Support:

**Basic Supply-Demand Formula:**
```
Token Price = f(Supply, Demand, Utility)

As Supply ↓ (via burns) and Demand → (stable or increasing)
Then Price → (upward potential)
```

### Projection Assumptions:

1. **Supply Reduction:** Progressive burns per schedule (-20% over 4 years)
2. **Demand:** Stable or growing community adoption
3. **Utility:** Increasing ecosystem use cases
4. **Market:** Neutral to positive sentiment

### Theoretical Outcomes:

| Year | Supply | Index | Implication |
|------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Year 0** | 1.0B | 1.0 | Baseline/Reference |
| **Year 1** | 950M | 1.08 | +8% potential |
| **Year 2** | 900M | 1.18 | +18% potential |
| **Year 3** | 850M | 1.28 | +28% potential |
| **Year 4+** | 800M | 1.40 | +40% potential |

### Important Disclaimers:

⚠️ **This is a theoretical model only**
⚠️ **Past performance ≠ future results**
⚠️ **Crypto markets are highly volatile**
⚠️ **Multiple factors affect price**
⚠️ **No guarantees or promises made**

### Real-world Variables:

- Market sentiment & crypto cycles
- Regulatory environment
- Competitive landscape
- Technology developments
- Partnership announcements
- Community growth rate
- Ecosystem utility expansion
