## 🛠️ Technical Definitions

### What is Token Burning?

**Technical Definition:**

```
Token Burning is a permanent process of transferring digital tokens
to a blockchain address that has no private key holder (Zero Address),
effectively destroying them permanently.

After Burning:
✅ Tokens are removed from circulation
✅ Supply is permanently reduced
✅ Recovery is mathematically impossible
✅ Process is irreversible
✅ Blockchain verifies permanence
```

### Zero Address Explained

**What is Zero Address?**

```
Address: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD

Characteristics:
✓ No owner or controller
✓ Officially recognized by blockchain
✓ No private key exists
✓ Tokens cannot be moved or recovered
✓ Action is permanent and irreversible
✓ Used universally for token destruction
✓ "dEaD" symbolizes tokens are destroyed

Why Zero Address (dEaD)?
✓ Ensures tokens are truly destroyed
✓ No one can access these tokens
✓ Publicly verifiable
✓ Blockchain standard method
✓ Tamper-proof and permanent
✓ Industry-recognized burn destination
```

### Irreversibility Explained

**Why Burn is Permanent:**

```
1. Blockchain Immutability
   • Transactions cannot be reversed
   • Ledger is permanent record
   • Network consensus confirms
   • No admin override exists

2. Zero Address Properties
   • No private key possible
   • No recovery mechanism
   • No owner to move tokens
   • Cryptographically impossible to access

3. Network Security
   • Thousands of nodes verify
   • Majority consensus required
   • Cannot change history
   • Tamper-proof by design
```
